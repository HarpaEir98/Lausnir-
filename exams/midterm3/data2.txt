The remains of Spanish dictator Francisco Franco are set to be moved from a vast mausoleum to a low-key grave.

Thursday's long-awaited relocation will fulfil a key pledge of the socialist government,
which said Spain should not continue to glorify a fascist who ruled the country for nearly four decades.

His family unsuccessfully challenged the reburial in the courts.

The Franco era continues to haunt Spain, now a robust democracy.
