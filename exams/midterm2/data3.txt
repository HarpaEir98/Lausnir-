The whistleblower whose complaint has led to an impeachment inquiry against President Donald Trump is a CIA officer, US media report.
The unnamed officer once worked at the White House, several US outlets said.
The whistleblower says senior White House officials tried to lock down all details of a phone call between Mr Trump and the Ukrainian president.
Mr. Trump demanded to know who gave information to the whistleblower, saying the source was close to a spy.
In the call on 25 July, Mr. Trump pushed Volodymyr Zelensky to investigate his leading Democratic political rival, Joe Biden.
The complaint, released on Thursday, says the call transcript was not stored in the usual computer system. Instead it was stored in a separate system used for classified information.
Impeachment is a two-stage political process, rarely exercised, by which a US president can be removed from office for wrongdoing.
Even if President Trump was impeached by the House of Representatives, he is unlikely to be forced out of the White House because Republicans control the Senate.
Speaking to BBC's US affiliate CBS News, 2016 Democratic White House candidate Hillary Clinton said she supported an impeachment inquiry into the "illegitimate president", whom she also called a corrupt human tornado.
Why is the phone call controversial?
