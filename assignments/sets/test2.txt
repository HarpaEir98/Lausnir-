A state weight inspector whose boss says
he tipped the scales at 500 pounds himself and "kept growing out
of the uniforms" is appealing his firing by the North Dakota
Highway Patrol.
Melvin Hansen of Wahpeton, who is awaiting a hearing before the
state Personnel Board on Wednesday, was given five reasons in
writing for being fired, including his weight, his lawyer, Hal
Stutsman, said Friday.
Hansen was dismissed July 31 from his job in a scale house where
he weighed trucks and inspected cargo.
"To say we terminated the guy because he was overweight is
basically unfair," said Brian Berg, superintendent of the Highway
Patrol. "I feel bad for the guy. We tried to work with him to
improve his situation. He left us no alternative, in our opinion."
Berg said Hansen's "weight probably contributed to other
things. ... Personal health habits would be a polite way of saying
it."
Highway Patrol policy requires employees to maintain
"appropriate health levels, weight levels and physical fitness
levels" as determined by the department's doctor, personnel
officer Richard Anagnost said.
Anagnost said Hansen was informed that reasons for his firing
included his failure to follow the doctor's recommendations about
weight loss, his appearance and grooming and his inability to wear
a uniform while on duty.
Hansen weighed 325 in 1983 and 500 pounds when he was fired,
Berg said. "He kept growing out of the uniforms. We refused to
keep altering them."
Stutsman refused to discuss details of the appeal, and Hansen
referred all questions to his lawyer when contacted Friday.
Stutsman called Hansen a "fairly good-sized man, that's for
sure," but he said his client's weight is disputed, in part
because "they have never really had an adequate scale to weigh him
on."
Hansen, in his 40s, had worked for the Highway Patrol since 1977
in the agency's truck regulatory division, Stutsman said. His exact
age was unavailable.

Fighting an image that Alaska is cold and
forsaken all year, the state tourism division is running new TV ads
that get a little good-natured revenge by poking fun at its
big-state rival, Texas.
Four years ago, former Texas Gov. Mark White said he didn't
believe anyone would want to visit Alaska, which he called a frozen
wasteland, said state tourism marketing director Mary Klugherz.
"We basically took that page from history" in making the
series of six commercials, Klugherz said.
In the commercials, a governor visits Alaska to see for himself
why people come here. The governor's state is not identified, "but
you can tell he's from Texas," Klugherz said. "He's sort of an
LBJ look-alike."
The governor also wears a 10-gallon hat and cowboy boots.
The first commercial shows the governor visiting Alaska and
discovering the summer weather is great. The second ad says the
governor's aides are coming north to look for him because he
apparently has decided he enjoys it in Alaska so much he stayed
longer than expected.
People still believe Alaska endures cold, snow and ice all year,
said Klugherz. "We're trying to tell travelers the truth," she
said.
July temperatures in Anchorage average in the high 50s, with
daytime temperatures often in the 60- to 70-degree range.
In past ad campaigns, tourism officials have pitched the state's
scenery and wildlife, Klugherz said. This year, "We're basically
hitting the weather head-on," she said.
The tourism division is spending $2.3 million to air the
commercials on network stations in 20 cities in the Lower 48. The
ads started running last month and will continue through April,
Klugherz said.
The ads will not run in Texas because it's too expensive to
advertise there, she said.
